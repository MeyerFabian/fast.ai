# fast.ai
My way into deep learning(neural networks) due to lessons at http://fast.ai
  * Action recognition with images: [Walk, run or jump](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/MeyerFabian/fast.ai/blob/master/01_Walk%2C_Run_or_Jump%2C_Action%20Recognition.ipynb)
  * Toxic classification challenge on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge): [Viewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/MeyerFabian/fast.ai/blob/master/02_Toxic_Comment_Classification_Challenge.ipynb)
    * Score is around 90.7% which is comparetively low. My gpu crashed when training more so i had to switch to colab to predict. More training would be needed.
